# SOLID Principles in C++

This repository contains examples and explanations related to the SOLID principles in the context of C++ programming. SOLID principles are a set of design guidelines that help write cleaner, maintainable, and flexible code.

## SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change. In this repository, you'll find examples demonstrating how to apply SRP in C++ and how to split classes and functions so that they have a single responsibility.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The OCP states that software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. You'll see examples of how to use inheritance and polymorphism in C++ to adhere to this principle.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The LSP states that objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the program's correctness. Here, examples will be presented to demonstrate how to ensure LSP compliance in C++.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The ISP states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. In this repository, we'll illustrate how to design C++ interfaces in a way that is cohesive and focused on the needs of the implementing classes.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The DIP states that dependencies should be directed towards abstractions, not concrete implementations. You'll see examples of applying dependency inversion using patterns like dependency injection in C++.

## Examples and Usage

Each directory within this repository contains specific examples related to one of the SOLID principles. You can explore them to understand how to apply these principles in your own C++ projects.
